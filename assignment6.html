            <h1>Lily's Assignment 6!</h1>
            <br>Here is all the documentation for assignment 6! (It is mostly copied from Assignment 5) <br> <br>
            For this assignment, I used two sensors, a photoresistor, a button, and a blue LED. When these received input, I was able to use Serial to 
            write to a webpage. The input data from the button and the photoresistor were printed in Serial, and then P5 Serial Control 
            was able to read from the serial port. I imported that data to a Javasript file, where I used the various input values to draw 
            using the draw() function. <br> 
            I was able to write from the website to serial, and then this data was read to the arduino and used to determine whether the LED was on or off.<br>
            I also used a button on my webpage, which was able to tell when someone had clicked it, and then send information to Serial. The input I sent to Serial was either a 1 or 
            Kay and Lia helped me with the code for reading and parsing the sensor values in javascript.
            <h2>Operation of Circuit</h2> <br>
            This gif shows the operation of my circuit:<br> <br>
            <p>
            <img src="a6gif.gif" width=400></a>
            </p> 
            My circuit did various things depending on the input. If the button was not pressed, it was a grid of dark and light blue 
            rectangles. If the button was pressed, the rectangles changed to purple and lime green. For the photoresisotr, when little light 
            was detected, a white circle would show up on the middle of the screen. When a lot of light was detected, the circle 
            would disappear. <br>
            You can see that when I had the photoresistor covered with a towel, the while circle stayed on the screen constantly. 
            Then, when I shined a light on it the white circle went away. <br> 
            Then, if I clicked the button on the screen, it turned the blue LED on on the breadboard.

            This image shows my circuit. I used pin A0 with the photoresistor so I could use AnalogRead(). <br> <br> <br>

                </p>
            <br>              
            <p> <br>
            <h2>The function of my system: </h2><br>
            I used my calculations from assignment 2 and assignment 3 for the correct resistors to use with the button and photoresistor, respectively. <br>
            <br><p style="font-size:130%;">To find the right resistor to use with the button, I used the equation: <br></p>
            5V = 0.035A*R <br>
            I used 0.035A because the max current for a button is 40mA; I used 35mA to be on the conservative side. The button doesnâ€™t have a voltage drop, so the 5V supplied by the arduino remain constant in the equation. <br>
            143ohm ~= R <br>
            So, I used the 220 ohm resistor because that was the closest to 143 ohms <br>
            
            To find the resistor value to use with the photoresistor, I had to do some calculations using 
            the min and max resistance of the photoresistor, depending on the amount of light it is exposed to. 
            I used the multimeter to get the max and min values, measuring when the lights were on, and when 
            the room was dark. These are the values I read: <br> <br>
            Rmin: 185 ohms <br>
            Rmax: 100k ohms <br> <br>
            
            Then, I looked for the resistor that would allow analogRead() to read the widest range of values possible 
            at the voltage divider. If the photoresistor were capturing the whole range, 
            the readings would go from 0-1023 (a full 5 volt range); mine only went from about 30 to 900, that's why I constrained 
            my range to those values in my void loop.<br> <br>
            Next, I calculated the Vout values for both the low and high resistance values; then, I subtracted 
            Vout_low from Vout_high to get the voltage range; 
            I checked for 220 ohms, and the range was pretty small, so I went up to 100k ohms, and the range was also small. 
            Then, I went down to 2k ohms and the range was 4.47V. I did the calculation for 10k ohms, and the range was slightly 
            smaller than the 2k resistor, at 4.45V. <br> <br>
            Even though the 10k resistor had a range that was a tiny bit smaller, I chose that resistor because I figured 
            using a higher resitor would be a safer bet, and the tiny difference in voltage range between 10k and 2k would 
            not make a visible difference. <br>
            <p>
                <img src="10kcalc.jpg" width=400 class="rotateimg180"></a>
            </p>                            
                Above are my calculations for the 2k and 10k ohm resistors. <br> <br> <br>

            For the blue LED's resistor, I used my calculations from assignment 1: <br>
            <p style="font-size:130%;">For the blue LED I used the 100 ohm resistor by calculating the following:</p>For the blue LED I used the 100 ohm resistor by calculating the following: <br> <br>
            5V-3.3V = 20mA * __ohms <br>
            1.6V/0.02A = 80 ohms <br>                80 ohms was closest to the 100 ohm resistor, so I chose that one <br>
            </p>
            
            <br> Here is my code for this assignment. <br><br>
            This is the arduino code. <br>
            For the input data from the button, I read either 1 (HIGH) or 0 (LOW). For the photoresistor, the values read ranged from 0-1023.
                <pre><code>
                    // makes a constant for the number of my pin connected to the button
                    const int buttonPin = 2;
                    // makes a constant for the number of my pin connected to the photoresistor
                    const int photoPin = A0;
                    // makes a constant for the number of my pin connected to the blue LED
                    const int ledPin = 10;

                    // initializes a value for the button reading
                    int button = 0;
                    // initializes a value for the photoresistor reading
                    int photo = 0;

                    void setup() {
                        Serial.begin(9600); // so I can see values in serial monitor
                        Serial.setTimeout(10); // set the timeout for parseInt
                        pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // configures the pin connected to the LED as output
                        pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); // configures pin connected to the button as input
                        pinMode(photoPin, INPUT); // configures pin connected to the photoresistor as input
                    }

                    void loop() {
                        button = digitalRead(buttonPin); // sets variable button to the pin of the button
                        photo = analogRead(photoPin); // sets variable photo to pin of photoresistor
                        int constPhoto = constrain(photo, 30, 900); // constrains input value to range most likely to be read
                        int mapPhoto = map(constPhoto,30, 900, 0, 200); // maps range to smaller range

                        Serial.print("["); // print [ in serial monitor
                        Serial.print(button); // prints the button reading value in the serial monitor
                        Serial.print(","); // prints a comma between button and photo values
                        // this is important for reading the data in javascript
                        Serial.print(mapPhoto); // prints photoresistor value and a newline
                        Serial.println("]"); // print ] in serial monitor
                        delay(50); // delay of 50 milliseconds

                        if (Serial.available() > 0) {   // if there's serial data and it is value greater than 0
                            int inByte = Serial.read(); // read it
                            Serial.write(inByte);   // send it back out as raw binary data
                            analogWrite(10, 255); // turn on the LED at max brightness
                        } else { // if the is not serial data greater than 0
                            analogWrite(10, 0); // do not turn on the LED
                        }

                    }

            This is the javascript code. I used example2 as my basis for this assignment, and altered it as needed. Kay helped me make the button function and html visual element.
