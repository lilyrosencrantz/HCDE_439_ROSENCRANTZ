            Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!

            My code:
            
            void setup() {
                // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
                // The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. It initializes variables, pin modes (from the arduino.cc website)
                pinMode(13, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 12 pin as output
                pinMode(10, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 10 pin as output
                pinMode(8, OUTPUT);     // sets the digital 8 pin as output
              }
              
              void loop() { //loop function means the code will run over and over forever
                digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the red LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                digitalWrite(10, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on at the same time as the red LED(HIGH is the voltage level)
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 of a second (red and blue LEDs blink at the same time)
                digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the red LED off by making the voltage LOW (blue stays on)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just blue LED is blinking)
                digitalWrite(10, LOW);    // turn the blue LED off by making the voltage LOW
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 a second (no LED is on)
                digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the yellow LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just yellow LED is blinking)
                digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the yellow LED off by making the voltage LOW
                delay(100);                       // wait for 1/10 of a second
              }
            </p>
