            Here is all the documentation for assignment 1!
            <br>

            My code:
            <br>
            void setup() { <br>
                // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. <br>
                // The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. It initializes variables, pin modes (from the arduino.cc website) <br>
                pinMode(13, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 12 pin as output <br>
                pinMode(10, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 10 pin as output <br>
                pinMode(8, OUTPUT);     // sets the digital 8 pin as output <br>
              } <br>
              <br>
              void loop() { //loop function means the code will run over and over forever <br>
                digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the red LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) <br>
                digitalWrite(10, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on at the same time as the red LED(HIGH is the voltage level) <br>
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 of a second (red and blue LEDs blink at the same time) <br>
                digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the red LED off by making the voltage LOW (blue stays on)  <br>
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just blue LED is blinking) <br>
                digitalWrite(10, LOW);    // turn the blue LED off by making the voltage LOW <br>
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 a second (no LED is on) <br>
                digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the yellow LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)  <br>
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just yellow LED is blinking) <br>
                digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the yellow LED off by making the voltage LOW <br>
                delay(100);                       // wait for 1/10 of a second <br>
              } <br>
            </p>
