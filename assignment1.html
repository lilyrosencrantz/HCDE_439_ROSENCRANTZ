            I chose <p style="color:aliceblue;">blue</p>, <p style="color:red;">red</p>, and <p style="color:yellow;">yellow</p> LEDs because I wanted to make sure I knew how to find the right resistors 
            for different colors of LEDs.

            <br>
            To find the value of the resistors I calculated using the respective voltage drop values for the red and yellow, and blue LEDs.
            <br>
            For red and yellow LEDS I used the 220 ohm resistor by calculating the following:
            <br>
            5V-1.8V = 20mA * __ohms <br>
            3.2V/0.02A = 160 ohms <br>
            160 ohms was closest to the 220 ohm resistor, so I chose that one <br>
            <br>
            For the blue LED I used the 100 ohm resistor by calculating the following: <br>
            5V-3.3V = 20mA * __ohms <br>
            1.6V/0.02A = 80 ohms <br>                80 ohms was closest to the 100 ohm resistor, so I chose that one <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            My code:
            <br>
            I wanted to make the lights blink both independently and at the same time. I wanted to be sure I knew 
            how to make both of those things happen, so I made the blue and red lights blink at the same time 
            between each of them blinking independently.
            <br>
            <pre><code>
            void setup() {
                // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
                // The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. It initializes variables, pin modes (from the arduino.cc website)
                pinMode(13, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 12 pin as output
                pinMode(10, OUTPUT);    // sets the digital 10 pin as output
                pinMode(8, OUTPUT);     // sets the digital 8 pin as output
              }
              
              void loop() { //loop function means the code will run over and over forever
                digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the red LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                digitalWrite(10, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on at the same time as the red LED(HIGH is the voltage level)
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 of a second (red and blue LEDs blink at the same time)
                digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the red LED off by making the voltage LOW (blue stays on)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just blue LED is blinking)
                digitalWrite(10, LOW);    // turn the blue LED off by making the voltage LOW
                delay(400);                       // wait for 4/10 a second (no LED is on)
                digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   // turn the yellow LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
                delay(500);                       // wait for half a second (just yellow LED is blinking)
                digitalWrite(8, LOW);    // turn the yellow LED off by making the voltage LOW
                delay(100);                       // wait for 1/10 of a second
              }
