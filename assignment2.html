            <h1>Lily's Assignment 2!</h1>
            <p>
            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2!

            <p>You can see the use of the for loop in the brightening and then fading of the LEDs after I press the button; look at the light's glow on the breadboard rather than at the LED to notice the variation.</p>
            <img src="Fade_schematic.jpg" width=600></a> <br> <br> 
            <p>This is my circuit; I used two LEDs and a button, which required three resistors.</p><br>
            <p>

            </p>            
            <br>This is my schematic. To find the value of the resistors I calculated using the respective voltage drop values for the red and yellow LEDS.
            <p style="font-size:130%;">For red and yellow LEDS I used the 220 ohm resistor by calculating the following:</p>
            <br>
            5V-1.8V = 20mA * __ohms <br>
            3.2V/0.02A = 160 ohms <br>
            160 ohms was closest to the 220 ohm resistor, so I chose that one <br>
            <br><p style="font-size:130%;">To find the right resistor to use with the button, I used the equation: <br></p>
            5V = 0.035A*R <br>
            I used 0.035A because the max current for a button is 40mA; I used 35mA to be on the conservative side. The button doesnâ€™t have a voltage drop, so the 5V supplied by the arduino remain constant in the equation. <br>
            143ohm ~= R <br>
            So, I used the 220 ohm resistor because that was the closest to 143 ohms <br>

            <pre><code> 
            // sets the pin number for the wire going to the button
            const int buttonPin = 2;
            // sets the red LED's pin #
            const int redPin = 10;
            // sets the yellow LED's pin #
            const int yellowPin = 11;

            // variable for reading the pushbutton status (comment from Button Example)
            int buttonState = 0; 

            void setup() {
              // initialize red and yellow LED pins as output:
              pinMode(redPin, OUTPUT);
              pinMode(yellowPin, OUTPUT);
              // inititalize the button's pin as input:
              pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
            }

            // this is a function to make the LEDs blink
            void blink() {
                // red and yelow pins blink for 3/10 of a second
                digitalWrite(redPin, HIGH); //
                digitalWrite(yellowPin, HIGH);
                delay(300);
                // red and yellow pins turn off for 3/10 of a second
                digitalWrite(redPin, LOW);
                digitalWrite(yellowPin, LOW);
                delay(300);
            }

            void loop() {
              buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
              // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
              // this checks if the button is pressed (it will read HIGH if yes):
              if (buttonState == HIGH) {
                // make red and yellow LEDs brighten by incrementing between 0 (always on) and 255 (always off):
                for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++){
                  analogWrite(yellowPin, i);
                  analogWrite(redPin, i);
                  delay(10);
                }
                // make red and yellow LEDs fade by decreasing between 255 and 0:
                for(int i = 250; i > 0; i--){
                  // turns yellow LED on
                  analogWrite(yellowPin, i);
                  // turns red LED on
                  analogWrite(redPin, i);
                  // wait for 1/100 of a second
                  delay(10);
                }
              // if the button is not pressed the LEDs go back to blinking
              } else {
                // make the red and yellow LEDs go back to blinking
                blink();
              }
            }
            </code>
