            <br>Here is all the documentation for assignment 4! <br> <br>
            
            <h2>Operation of Circuit</h2> <br>
            <p>

            </p> 
            This gif shows the operation of my circuit:<br> <br>
            I used a remote sensor and a transistor to be able to control an LED strip's state by pressing buttons 
            on a remote.
            This project uses remote sensing and an N-MOSFET transistor. The purpose of this was to 
            control an LED strip with a higher load than the arduino can support; to use a transistor to control 
            load power separate from logic power.<br> <br>
            <h2>Circuit</h2> <br>
            <p>
                <img src="small_circuit.jpg" width=400></a>
                </p>
            <p>
            This image shows a zoomed-in view of my circuit. I connected the transistor to pin ~10 
            because I needed a pin I could analogWrite() to.  <br> <br> <br>
                <img src="wide_circuit.jpg" width=400></a>
                </p>
            This is zoomed-out view of my circuit (not plugged into my computer).  <br> 
            Kathy and Emily helped me figure out all the wiring during class.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Schematic</h2> <br>
            <p>
                <img src="schematic4.jpg" width=400 class="rotateimg180"></a>
                </p>
            <p>
            Here is my schematic. Lia helped me figure out how to draw the LED strip in my schematic. It shows that 
            the D pin of the transistor is attached to the LED stip, the S pin is connected to GND, and the G pin is 
            connected to pin ~10. The infrared sensor, used to pick up signals from the remote 
            so I can control the LED, gets its volatage from 5V on the arduino (R), not the 12V like the LED strip. 
            I connected pin 7 to Y on the sensor, which reads input that is received in HEX codes from the remote. 
            The voltage travels to ground (G). <br> <br> <br>
            <h2>Calculations for Current</h2> <br>
                <img src="led_calc4.jpg" width=400 class="rotateimg180"></a>
                </p>
            These are the calculations I did to figure out whether the current I was putting through the 
            transistor was an amount it could handle. The total current going through the LED 
            strip is 0.66A, which is far less than the transistor's max current of 32A. <br>
            I also figured I would find the R total for all of the LED segments. I did this by using 
            the Resistance formula for things in parallel. <br> <br>
            1/Rtot = (1/181)*100 <br>
            I know the resistance for each 3-LED segment was 181, and so added 1/R for each of those segments. 
            From that calculation I got Rtot= 1.81 ohms. <br>
            From there I could double-check my current calculations by doing <br> <br>
            Vtot = Itot * Rtot <br>
            1.2V = Itot * 1.81ohms <br>
            1.2V/1.81ohms = Itot = .66A <br>
            Matching my calcution done in the photo above. <br>
            Kay, Lia, and I worked through these together to make sure we were getting the correct values.
            <br>              
            <p> <br>
            <h2>The function of my system: </h2><br>
            I used the remote and sensor to conrtol my LED strip. I coded my remote to match certain functions 
            with numbers on the remote: <br> <br>
            0: zero on the remote turned the LED strip on to max brightness (255 in the duty cycle), which is like turning the LED to HIGH using 
            digitalWrite(). <br>
            1: turns the LED off by using analogWrite() to write 0 to the transitor pin <br>
            2: Makes the LED strip incrementally brighter by using a loop <br>
            3: Makes the LED strip incrementally dimmer by using a loop <br>
            4: Uses a loop to make a blinking pattern repeat 5 times using the LED strip
            
            <br> Here is my code for this assignment. I based my code off an example from Circuit Basics (http://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/) <br><br>
                <pre><code>
                    // include IR remote library so I can use my remote
                    #include <IRremote.h>
                    
                    // set a variable equal the pin for the remote sensor
                    const int sensPin = 7;
                    // set variable equal to pin for transistor
                    const int transPin = 10;
                    // sets a key_value for what key has been pressed on the remote
                    unsigned long key_value = 0;
                    
                    // creates an object irrecv
                    IRrecv irrecv(sensPin);
                    //creates a variable to store the results of the button press
                    decode_results results;
                    
                    // this setup code runs once
                    void setup() {
                      // tells arduino to communicate with serial monitor
                      Serial.begin(9600);
                      // enables the remote sensor to "listen" for signals
                      irrecv.enableIRIn();
                    
                      // transistor pin is set as output
                      pinmode(transPin, OUTPUT);
                    }
                    
                    // this code will run in a repeated loop
                    void loop() {
                    
                      // checking to see if a signal has been received from the remote sensor
                      if (irrecv.decode(&results)){
                      
                        // if a code has been recieved, check what it is. 0XFFFFFFFF
                        if (results.value == 0XFFFFFFFF) {

                          results.value = key_value;
                        }

                          // turns LED strip to HIGH when 0 is pressed
                          analogWrite(transPin, 255);
